Jack, The Janitor
=========================

### The Game

Jack, The Janitor is a puzzle game where the player controls Jack, a school's
janitor who must organize the school's warehouse. Jack can push boxes to the
left or to the right and jump boxes.

When jack fills an entire row with boxes, they disappear from the screen and go
to a small window on the right side of he screen called the closet.

The closet shows how jack organized the rows of boxes. When similar boxes are
combined in the closet, Jack gets extra points and some power ups (to be
implemented).

The game ends if a falling box hits Jack or if the closet gets full.

### Development

At the moment, Jack, The Janitor is under development by the WareHouse team, in
Universidade de Bras√≠lia, Brazil.
